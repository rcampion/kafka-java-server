# Start the ZooKeeper service
# Note: Soon, ZooKeeper will no longer be required by Apache Kafka.
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Open another terminal session and run:

# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.

Create a Kafka Topic
Now that you have the broker and Zookeeper running, you can specify a topic to start sending messages from a producer. Youâ€™re going to run a command inside the bin folder, just like you did in the previous steps:

./kafka-topics.sh --create --topic myTopic -zookeeper \
 localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
